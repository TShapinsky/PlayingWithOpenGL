# Playing with OpenGL

## Goals

   I plan to make a basic 3d environment navigable via mouse and keyboard. The MVP would be a simple animation of a 3D environment.

## Learning Goals

   By working on this project I hope to gain a better understanding of how OpenGL works and how to use it.

## Getting Started

   To get started I used GLUT and OpenGL to draw graphics, and get mouse and keyboard events. 
   
   Good Resources I've found are the glut and opengl tutorials on http://www.lighthouse3d.com/ along with the GLUT spec on http://opengl.org

## Left To Do

   At this point I want to add more things to the environment to make it more interesting to move around in. This will require adding more data structures to store objects and logic to render them to the environment.
