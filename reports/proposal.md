# Playing with OpenGL

## Goals

   I plan to make a basic 3d environment navigable via mouse and keyboard. The MVP would be a simple animation of a 3D environment.

## Learning Goals

   By working on this project I hope to gain a better understanding of how OpenGL works and how to use it.

## Getting Started

   To get started I've settled on using GLUT, since most of the literature I've found on baseline OpenGL and GLSL is for C++ and that is not the focus of the class.

## First Steps

   1. Get OpenGL set up on linux - Toby
   2. Get a basic shape (triangle) rendering in C. - Toby
   3. Get a 3D shape (Sphere?) rendering in C - Toby
