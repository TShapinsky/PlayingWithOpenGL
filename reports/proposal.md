# Playing with OpenGL

1. What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.

   I plan to make a basic 3d environment navigable via mouse and keyboard. The MVP would be a simple animation of a 3D environment.

2. What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?

   By working on this project I hope to gain a better understanding of how OpenGL works and how to use it.

3.  What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?

   To get started I've settled on using GLUT, since most of the literature I've found on baseline OpenGL and GLSL is for C++ and that is not the focus of the class.

4. What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  For each one, what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?

   1. Get OpenGL set up on linux - Toby
   2. Get a basic shape (triangle) rendering in C. - Toby
   3. Get a 3D shape (Sphere?) rendering in C - Toby
